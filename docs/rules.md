**ATTRIBUTES**


| Name  | Description | Type | Mandatory | Default |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-name"></a>name |  A unique name for this target.   | <a href="https://bazel.build/concepts/labels#target-names">Name</a> | required |  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-deps"></a>deps |  The list of nim or cc dependencies of the current target.   | <a href="https://bazel.build/concepts/labels">List of labels</a> | optional |  `[]`  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-additional_compiler_inputs"></a>additional_compiler_inputs |  List of additional files needed for compilation of srcs   | <a href="https://bazel.build/concepts/labels">List of labels</a> | optional |  `[]`  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-additional_linker_inputs"></a>additional_linker_inputs |  Pass these files to the C++ linker command.<br><br>For example, compiled Windows .res files can be provided here to be embedded in the binary target.   | <a href="https://bazel.build/concepts/labels">List of labels</a> | optional |  `[]`  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-conlyopts"></a>conlyopts |  Add these options to the C compilation command. Subject to "Make variable" substitution and Bourne shell tokenization.   | List of strings | optional |  `[]`  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-copts"></a>copts |  Add these options to the C++ compilation command. Subject to "Make variable" substitution and Bourne shell tokenization. Each string in this attribute is added in the given order to COPTS before compiling the binary target. The flags take effect only for compiling this target, not its dependencies, so be careful about header files included elsewhere. All paths should be relative to the workspace, not to the current package.<br><br>If the package declares the feature no_copts_tokenization, Bourne shell tokenization applies only to strings that consist of a single "Make" variable.   | List of strings | optional |  `[]`  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-cxxopts"></a>cxxopts |  Add these options to the C++ compilation command. Subject to "Make variable" substitution and Bourne shell tokenization.   | List of strings | optional |  `[]`  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-defines"></a>defines |  List of defines to add to the compile line. Subject to "Make" variable substitution and Bourne shell tokenization. Each string, which must consist of a single Bourne shell token, is prepended with -D and added to the compile command line to this target, as well as to every rule that depends on it. Be very careful, since this may have far-reaching effects. When in doubt, add define values to local_defines instead.   | List of strings | optional |  `[]`  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-includes"></a>includes |  List of include dirs to be added to the compile line. Subject to "Make variable" substitution. Each string is prepended with -isystem and added to COPTS. Unlike COPTS, these flags are added for this rule and every rule that depends on it. (Note: not the rules it depends upon!) Be very careful, since this may have far-reaching effects. When in doubt, add "-I" flags to COPTS instead.<br><br>Headers must be added to srcs or hdrs, otherwise they will not be available to dependent rules when compilation is sandboxed (the default).   | List of strings | optional |  `[]`  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-linkopts"></a>linkopts |  Add these flags to the C++ linker command. Subject to "Make" variable substitution, Bourne shell tokenization and label expansion. Each string in this attribute is added to LINKOPTS before linking the binary target. Each element of this list that does not start with $ or - is assumed to be the label of a target in deps. The list of files generated by that target is appended to the linker options. An error is reported if the label is invalid, or is not declared in deps.   | List of strings | optional |  `[]`  |
| <a id="nim_cc_binary-linkstatic"></a>linkstatic |  "Link the artifact in static mode.<br><br>For cc_binary and cc_test: link the binary in static mode.
